You first need to understand the current (e.g., existing) scheduling policy. Locate it in the
code and try to answer the following questions: 

1) which process the policy chooses to run?

2) what happens when a process returns from I/O?
 
3) what happens when a new process is created?

4) and when/how often scheduling takes place?
